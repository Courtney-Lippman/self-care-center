# Self-Care Center

### Abstract:
The world has become high stakes and high stress. People forget how important it is to take the time and do some self care. That is where the Self Care Center application comes in. The application allows users to generate affirmations and mantras that support wellbeing. Users can also save their favorite messages which can be viewed on the favorite messages page. If the user decides that they do not like a favorite message, they have the option to delete it by selecting the message they want to delete and then hit the delete button.

### Context:
Building Self Care Center was my second solo project, but the first project where I completely built out the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. I completed the project at the end of my third week at Turing School of Software and Design. Self Care Center was a great opportunity for me to see how much I have grown in such a short period.

### Learning Goals:

1. Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
2. Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
3. Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
4. Individualize your programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:
I really enjoyed learning how to build out my HTML and match the comp with CSS. Flex box was a great tool that I found to be intuitive to use.
The biggest challenge that I faced was learning to manipulate html elements that I created in javascript. After a lot of research and manipulating my code, I was able to manipulate html elements and create complex functionality.
